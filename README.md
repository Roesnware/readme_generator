# README generator

    ## Description
    
    I want to create a program that takes input from a developer and actually makes a quality README.md file using that data in cmd line.
    This program allows users the ability to make a good quality README from commmand line without having to make the file themselves and stress over markdown syntax.
    I learned markdown syntax tricks, aswell as how to work with node.js.
